Nova


# Description
Nova is a tool to measure your social presence online. It rates your current online presence based on the amount of attention
your recent posts receive and your recent activity. A score is assessed along with recommendations on how to improve yourself 
and grow your online presence based on the activity of your network. In addition, your network can be motivated to assist you 
in your self improvement goals by investing virtual currency in your success. The goal is to simulate a social stock market 
that aims to improve the social and professional online presences of its users.
